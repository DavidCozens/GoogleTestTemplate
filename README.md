# GoogleTestTemplate

A template for creating a new unit test project based on googletest.

The template includes configuration for [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and for [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) both using the same docker container [davidcozens/googletest](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/davidcozens/googletest).

The templates are for my own use, if you find it useful please star the repos :smile:
